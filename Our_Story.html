					<h3>The Origami Owl Story</h3>
						<p>I started Origami Owl with $350 and a simple dream in mind—getting a car on my 16th birthday. When I was 14, I asked my parents for a car but they said I needed to work for it. So, with all of my babysitting money and my family’s support, I set out to start my own business and created Origami Owl.
Immediately, people loved creating stories with jewelry and women began asking how they could share Origami Owl with their own family and friends. We were a hit! After hearing stories about how our jewelry touched lives, it only made sense to spread some love across the country. Today, we have more than 60,000 Independent Designers who pursue their own dreams by selling our jewelry at home parties we like to call Jewelry Bars.
OUR MISSION IS TO BE A FORCE FOR GOOD; TO LOVE, INSPIRE
+ MOTIVATE PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO REACH THEIR DREAMS +
EMPOWER THEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF OTHERS.
But there is something else I want you to know, we’ve always been so much more than just a jewelry company. From the beginning I wanted my company to be different, I wanted it to be a force for good; to help others achieve their dreams like I achieved mine (yes, I finally got my car; a white Jeep I named Alice). It didn’t happen overnight, but with lots of hard work, Origami Owl grew from my after school job to a multimillion dollar company.
It’s been such an incredible journey and I believe our continued success has come from our intention to make a difference in people’s lives, we never put profits before people.
Our story is only just beginning to unfold and I hope it can be a part of your story too. Take a look around to build your own meaningful Living Locket®, or to find out how you can join our family!
